# Assets Directory

This directory contains assets used for video generation:

- `reddit_logo.png` - Reddit logo used for profile pictures in social media frames
- Custom fonts (if added)
- Icons and other visual elements

These assets are used to create the Reddit-like UI frames around meme images, supporting both dark mode and light mode themes.

## Theme Options

The application supports both light and dark mode for the Reddit frames:

- **Dark mode**: Modern dark UI that reduces eye strain and looks more contemporary
- **Light mode**: Classic Reddit look with white background and dark text

You can toggle between these modes by setting the `dark_mode` parameter in the Config class.

## Animation Levels

Three animation levels are available:
- **low**: Minimal animations for faster rendering
- **medium**: Balanced animations for good visual appeal
- **high**: Maximum animations for the most engaging content
